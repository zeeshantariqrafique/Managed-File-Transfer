A python utility to transfer files through socket

The intention of this project is to enable real time and platform independant managed file transfer between servers .

Capabilities that are to be built :
- AES encryption
- Multiport transfer to increase transfer speed throughput 

Goal :
- Match the file transfer speed of Apache Kafka at much lighter weight for small scale applications and provide real time stream processing. 
- 20x faster than ftp and sftp protocol.
- Avoid username/password authentication like stfp , Plug and Play peer to peer security feature on initial setup .
